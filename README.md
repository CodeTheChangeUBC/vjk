Database

Summary
The project consists of two smaller sub projects. The first is to develop a database to contain all of the organizationâ€™s outreach information. This will consist of donors, sponsors, students, and first nation community contacts. The database should be easily searchable and have the capability to send mass emails to selected groups. The second project is a small addon to their website which will contain a list of scholarships that First Nations high school students are eligible for.

Additionally, python is a popular language for data analytics which may be useful for future iterations.
